The Unidata network Common Data Form (netCDF) is an interface for scientific
data access and a set of freely-distributed software libraries that provide an
implementation of the interface. The netCDF library also defines a
machine-independent format for representing scientific data. Together, the
interface, library, and format support the creation, access, and sharing of
scientific data. This software package provides Fortran application interfaces
for accessing netCDF data. It depends on the netCDF C library, which must be
installed first.
