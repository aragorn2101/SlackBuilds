The elsarticle package contains the Elsevier article class for LaTeX.
It also includes some common manuscript templates, associated
bibliographic/BibTeX styles, and the relevant documentation. The
package is available on CTAN. The Elsevier article class helps you to
format the frontmatter of your manuscript properly, when submitting
your papers to jounals published by Elsevier.

The elsarticle-texcls package wraps up the elsarticle CTAN package for
Slackware so that the class can be integrated safely into Slacware's
TeXlive environment safely.
