# SlackBuilds

SlackBuilds scripts for several packages targeting the Slackware GNU/Linux 15.0
operating system.

## ds9 8.2.1

SAO Image DS9 is an astronomical imaging and data visualization application. DS9
is a stand-alone application which supports FITS images and binary tables,
multiple frame buffers, region manipulation, and many scale algorithms and
colormaps.  DS9 supports a consistent set of GUI and functional capabilities,
as well as advanced features such as 2-D, 3-D and RGB frame buffers, mosaic
images, tiling, blinking, geometric markers, colormap manipulation, scaling,
arbitrary zoom, cropping, rotation, pan, and a variety of coordinate systems.
The GUI for DS9 is user configurable. GUI elements such as the coordinate
display, panner, magnifier, horizontal and vertical graphs, button bar, and
color bar can be configured via menus or the command line.


## karma 1.7.25

ATNF CSIRO Karma is a package for signal and image processing
applications. It contains KarmaLib (the structured library and API)
and a large number of modules and applications to perform many standard
tasks on astronomical data in common formats like FITS. It is a toolkit
for manipulating the Karma network data structure.

Another major component of KarmaLib is the display support. The display
system both provides an abstract interface to the underlying graphics
system (ie. the X window system), and also provides much higher level
functionality than many graphics libraries. As well as supporting simple
geometric primitives and text display, a powerful and flexible image
display system is included. This allows the direct mapping of
application data structures (ie. 2-D and 3-D arrays) to display
windows (canvases).

This SlackBuild script builds a Slackware package from the official
binary distributed by CSIRO.


## latex2rtf 2.3.17

latex2rtf is a translator program to convert LaTeX formatted text files into
"rich text format" (RTF) files. RTF is a published standard format by
Microsoft. This standard can be ambiguous in places, but RTF is supported by
many text editors. Specifically, it is supported by Microsoft Word. This means
that the conversion of a LaTeX document to RTF allows anyone with a copy of
Word to convert LaTeX files to Word .doc or .docx files.

Features

- Conversion of a wide range of input encodings
- Conversion of equations (unfortunately using the broken Microsoft
  implementation of EQ fields)
- Conversion of tables
- Conversion of graphics
- Conversion of cross-references
- Conversion of bibliographies

latex2rtf translates the text and as much of the formatting information from
LaTeX to RTF. Be forewarned that the typeset output is not nearly as good as
what you would get from using LaTeX directly.
