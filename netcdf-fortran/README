NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a set of interfaces for array-oriented
data access and a freely-distributed collection of data access libraries for C,
Fortran, C++, Java, and other languages. The netCDF libraries support a
machine-independent format for representing scientific data. Together, the
interfaces, libraries, and format support the creation, access, and sharing of
scientific data.

The netcdf-fortran package provides Fortran application interfaces for
accessing netCDF data. It depends on the netCDF C library, which must be
installed first.
