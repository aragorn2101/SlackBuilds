# Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model

WRF is a state-of-the-art atmospheric modeling system designed for both
meteorological research and numerical weather prediction. It offers a host of
options for atmospheric processes and can run on a variety of computing
platforms. WRF excels in a broad range of applications across scales ranging
from tens of meters to thousands of kilometers The Mesoscale and Microscale
Meteorology Laboratory (MMM) of NCAR supports the WRF system to the user
community, and maintains the WRF code on GitHub. Check out

for more.


We propose installation scripts for WRF ARW (Advanced Research WRF). The source
can be obtained from the ARW users' page
([https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/)).

By default, WRF ARW is compiled in a directory where the user has write access,
and the full source code is kept. Normally WRF and its pre-processor WPS are
run directly from the source code directories.
